References are an alias for existing variables - they are implemented by storing the memory address of the existing variable.

References differ from pointers in three key ways:
- a reference cannot do pointer-specific operations i.e. pointer arithmetic
- a reference essentially does dereferencing for you i.e. it acts exactly like the other variable
- always points to the same memory address i.e. it is a constant pointer
